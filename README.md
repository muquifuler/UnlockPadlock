 Guess the secret combination to win! #Web3 #PlayFi for Binance Smart Chain.
 
Alpha 0.9v -> https://autotoken.tech/UnlockPadlock/index.php

Blockchain game based on wordle with the fundamental characteristic of not paying or using functions that change state variables during the game.

ATTENTION! you do not have to guess a word but a combination of characters, the less attempts you need the greater benefit

Why is it not in version 1.0? Currently it is possible to do infinite checks by executing the correct function in the console, I made a new version with a centralized database that checked a hash with the smart contract, in short I was not happy with the centralization and the unnecessary complication that it was, so So I decided to leave it like this and continue with new projects.
